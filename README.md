This workflow was created by Josef Erneker. My site is under development yet, but you may check it out, there are some sections ready, e.g. documentation for this workflow https://jotc.herokuapp.com/ .

This workflow serves for quick access and searching through Stash directories on your server.

It depends on the following gems:
nokogiri, rest-client and json.

Installing gems is easy. From Terminal run command “sudo gem install <name of the gem>”. Run installation of the gems first or if you see in logs messages about missing dependencies.

1) see the documentation: https://jotc.herokuapp.com/software/alfred_workflows
2) set up credentials for Asana
3) go through setup tasks in the documentation and see what you want to set up/activate

You may find logs and other files used by this workflow in $HOME/Library/Application Support/Alfred 2/Workflow Data/com.herokuapp.jotc.asana directory

Enjoy! :-)
